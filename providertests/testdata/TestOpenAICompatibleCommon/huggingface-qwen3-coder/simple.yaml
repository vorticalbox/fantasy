It''s understood in **Portugal** but less common than \"Olá.\"\n\n### The All-Purpose \"Hello\"\n\n*   **Olá!** (Oh-LAH)\n    This is the most versatile greeting. It can be used in both formal and informal situations, anytime of day, and is common in both **Brazil and Portugal**. If you''re unsure which one to use, \"Olá\" is always a safe choice.\n\n### Greetings by Time of Day\n\nJust like in English, you can greet people based on the time of day. These are used in all Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\n*   **Bom dia** (bong DEE-ah) — Good morning\n*   **Boa tarde** (boh-AH tardjee) — Good afternoon\n*   **Boa noite** (boh-AH noytchee) — Good evening / Good night\n    *   Note: You use **Boa noite** to greet someone in the evening and also to say goodnight when leaving or going to bed.\n\n### A Quick Summary\n\n| English        | Portuguese           | Formality               | Best for...                               |\n|:-------------- |:---------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------|\n| Hi             | **Oi!**              | Informal                | Friends, family, casual situations (BR)   |\n| Hello          | **Olá!**             | Formal / Informal       | Any situation, anywhere. The safest bet.  |\n| Good morning   | **Bom dia**          | Formal / Informal       | Before noon.                              |\n| Good afternoon | **Boa tarde**        | Formal / Informal       | From noon until the evening.              |\n| Good evening   | **Boa noite**        | Formal / Informal       | In the evening and to say goodnight.      |\n\nWant to follow up \"hi\" with \"how are you?\" The most common way is:\n\n*   **Tudo bem?** (Too-doh beng?) — Literally \"Everything well?\" but used as \"How are you?\"","reasoning":"\n1.  **Analyze the User''s Request:** The user wants to know how to say \"hi\" in Portuguese. This is a very direct, simple translation request.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Task:** Translate the English word \"hi\" into its Portuguese equivalent(s).\n\n3.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Association:**\n    *   Portuguese.\n    *   Greeting.\n    *   \"Hi\".\n    *   \"Hello\".\n    *   Informal. Formal.\n    *   Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.\n    *   What are the variations?\n    *   In what contexts are they used?\n    *   Brazil vs. Portugal. Are there differences? (This is a key point for any Romance language).\n\n4.  **Structure the Answer:** I want to provide more than just a single word. A good answer will be helpful, clear, and provide context. A good structure would be:\n    *   Start with the most direct and common answer.\n    *   Provide alternatives (formal/informal, different times of day).\n    *   Explain the differences and when to use each one.\n    *   Mention the Brazil vs. Portugal distinction, as it''s very important for Portuguese.\n    *   Add a little \"extra\" – like how to ask \"How are you?\" to make the interaction more natural. This anticipates the user''s next logical question.\n    *   End with a friendly closing.\n\n5.  **Drafting - Section by Section:**\n\n    *   **Direct Answer (The \"TL;DR\"):** The most common and direct translation of \"hi\" is **\"Oi\"**. I''ll put this first, in bold, to make it stand out immediately.\n\n    *   **Elaboration on \"Oi\":**\n        *   Pronunciation: \"oh-ee\". This is crucial for a non-speaker. I should include a simple phonetic guide.\n        *   Usage: It''s informal, like \"hi\" in English. Used with friends, family, people you know well. It''s very common in Brazil. It''s used in Portugal too, but maybe slightly less than other greetings? (I should double-check this. Yes, it''s understood and used in Portugal, but *Olá* is perhaps more standard/multi-purpose there). I''ll make a note of this.\n\n    *   **Formal/Basic Greeting:** The equivalent of \"Hello\" is **\"Olá\"**.\n        *   Pronunciation: \"oh-LAH\". I need to mention the stress on the second syllable.\n        *   Usage: It''s more versatile than \"Oi\". It can be used in formal and informal situations. It works anytime of day. It''s the safest bet if you''re unsure. It''s extremely common in both Brazil and Portugal.\n\n    *   **Time-of-Day Greetings:** This is a standard part of Romance languages and very useful for the user.\n        *   **Bom dia:** \"Good morning.\"\n        *   **Boa tarde:** \"Good afternoon.\"\n        *   **Boa noite:** \"Good evening / Good night.\"\n        *   I should explain that \"Boa noite\" is used both as a greeting in the evening and as a way to say goodbye at night. This is a common point of confusion for English speakers. I''ll explicitly state this.\n        *   I''ll also add a quick pronunciation guide for each one. This adds a lot of value.\n\n    *   **Brazil vs. Portugal Nuances:** This is a great \"value-add.\"\n        *   In **Brazil**: \"Oi\" is super common and informal. \"E aí?\" (Eh-eye?) or \"Beleza?\" are very common informal follow-ups, like \"What''s up?\". I should include this to make the greeting more complete and natural.\n        *   In **Portugal**: \"Olá\" is the most standard. Informal greetings might include \"Viva\" (a bit more enthusiastic/older-fashioned but still used) or simply \"Está tudo bem?\". I should mention that \"Oi\" is understood but less common than in Brazil. Using \"Olá\" is a safer bet for a tourist.\n\n    *   **Putting it all together (A summary table/list):** A quick summary helps users scan and find the right option quickly. I''ll create a simple list format:\n\n        *   **Informal \"Hi\":** Oi (Mostly Brazil, but understood everywhere)\n        *   **Universal \"Hello\":** Olá (Works in any situation)\n        *   **By time of day:** Bom dia / Boa tarde / Boa noite\n\n    *   **Bonus Content:** How to ask \"How are you?\"\n        *   Common phrase: **Tudo bem?** (Too-doh beng?)\n        *   Explain it means \"Is everything well?\" or just \"How are you?\".\n        *   Explain the standard response: **Tudo bem.** (Everything''s well.) or **Tudo bom.** (Everything''s good.) This is a very common exchange and teaching both sides is very helpful.\n\n6.  **Review and Refine:** Read through the entire answer.\n    *   Is it clear? Yes.\n    *   Is it accurate? Yes.\n    *   Is it easy to read? The use of bolding, bullet points, and lists helps a lot.\n    *   Is the tone helpful and friendly? Yes.\n    *   Did I answer the user''s question directly and also provide useful, related information? Yes. The structure from simple to complex works well. The pronunciation guides are a key feature. The Brazil/Portugal distinction is an important detail. The \"How are you?\" part is a proactive addition.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1762855217,"model":"zai-glm-4.6","system_fingerprint":"fp_b78e4418d824cdcd64e8","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"total_tokens":1714,"completion_tokens":1698,"prompt_tokens":16},"time_info":{"queue_time":0.000135781,"prompt_time":0.003248146,"completion_time":2.603353152,"total_time":2.6080667972564697,"created":1762855217.1120505}}'
